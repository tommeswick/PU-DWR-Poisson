# PU-DWR-Poisson
Goal-oriented a posteriori error control and local mesh adaptivity with a partition-of-unity dual-weighted residual method applied to the Poisson problem. This program is based on the deal.II library www.dealii.org. Compilation and running the program follows the typical procedure as for other deal.II tutorial steps. Please see https://www.dealii.org/current/readme.html and https://www.dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html.
