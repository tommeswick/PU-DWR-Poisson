# PU-DWR-Poisson
Goal-oriented a posteriori error control and local mesh adaptivity with a partition-of-unity dual-weighted residual method applied to the Poisson problem. This program is based on the deal.II library www.dealii.org. Compilation and running the program follows the typical procedure as for other deal.II tutorial steps. Please see https://www.dealii.org/current/readme.html and https://www.dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html. 

The mathematical, numerical and algorithmic background of this program is provided in T. Richter, T. Wick; Variational Localizations of the Dual-Weighted Residual Estimator, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Vol. 279 (2015), pp. 192-208 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2014.11.008
